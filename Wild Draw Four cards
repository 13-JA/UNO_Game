Now, we have to add the wild draw four cards to the Uno game.

We'll make the following changes:

1. Modify WildCard: We'll add add a can_play method to the WildCard class to check if the card can be played based on the player's hand and the top card of the pile.

2. Update UnoDeck: We'll include the "Wild Draw Four" cards in the deck initialization.

3. Update UnoPlayer.take turn: We'll handle the logic for playing "Wild Draw Four" cards, ensuring they can only be played when valid and executing the draw four and skip turn actions.

Now our Uno game includes the Wild Draw Four cards! The player can only play them IF they have no matching color cards in their hand, and it makes the next player draw 4 cards and skip their turn.
