I added the wild cards to my code, which is now different with the added wild cards, from my code from the "Advancing from skeleton code" text file.

Here's how I added the wild cards:

First, we'll need to create a new WildCard class that inherits from ActionCard.
The new WildCard class will represent the wild cards.

Next, we need to modify the UnoDeck class to include the wild cards in the deck.

Finally, we will modify the method to handle wild cards (as suggested in the hints) to handle the wild cards when they are played.
This allows the players to change the color of the game and, in the case of "Wild Draw Four" card, we can make the next player draw four cards and skip their turn.

MY CODE:
import random

class UnoCard:
    '''represents an Uno card
    attributes:
      rank: int from 0 to 9
      color: string'''

    def __init__(self, rank, color):
        '''UnoCard(rank, color) -> UnoCard
        creates an Uno card with the given rank and color'''
        self.rank = rank
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        '''str(Unocard) -> str'''
        return(str(self.color) + ' ' + str(self.rank))

    def is_match(self, other):
        '''UnoCard.is_match(UnoCard) -> boolean
        returns True if the cards match in rank or color, False if not'''
        return (self.color == other.color) or (self.rank == other.rank)

class ActionCard(UnoCard):
    '''represents an Uno action card
    attributes:
      action: string, either 'skip', 'reverse', or 'drawTwo'
      color: string
    '''
    def __init__(self, action, color):
        '''ActionCard(action, color) -> ActionCard
        creates an Uno action card with the given action and color'''
        self.action = action
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        '''str(ActionCard) -> str'''
        return(self.color + ' ' + self.action)

    def is_match(self, other):
        '''ActionCard.is_match(UnoCard) -> boolean
        returns True if the cards match in action or color, False if not'''
        return (self.color == other.color) or (self.action == other.action)

#Hint(s): This probably involves modifying UnoCard.is_match() method to account for 
#wild cards, and also adding some code somewhere that lets the player specify the new color.
